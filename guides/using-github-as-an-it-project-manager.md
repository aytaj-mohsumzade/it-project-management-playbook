# Using GitHub as an IT Project Manager (Non-Developer View)

I use GitHub not only as a code hosting platform, but also as a **project management tool**.



## 1. Key GitHub concepts for PMs

- **Repository (repo)** – a project space; can hold code, docs, images, etc.  
- **Issues** – individual work items (stories, bugs, tasks).  
- **Projects (Project boards)** – Kanban or table views to manage Issues and PRs.  
- **Labels** – tags to group work (epic, sprint, priority, etc.).  
- **Pull Requests (PRs)** – proposals to change code; useful for tracking what is being merged.



## 2. Typical workflow I use

1. **Write requirements** in markdown files in the repo (e.g. `requirements/user-stories.md`).  
2. **Create Issues** for user stories or technical tasks.  
3. Add **labels** such as:
   - Epic (e.g. `EP-01 Core Task Management`)  
   - Sprint (e.g. `Sprint 1 – MVP`)  
   - Type (Story / Bug / Chore)  
4. Add Issues to a **GitHub Project board** with columns like:
   - Todo  
   - In Progress  
   - In Review (optional)  
   - Done  
5. Use **workflows/automations** where possible (e.g. closing an Issue moves it to Done).


## 3. How this helps collaboration

- Developers stay in the tools they already use (GitHub).  
- PMs and stakeholders can see **real-time status** without asking for separate reports.  
- Written history (Issues, comments, PRs) helps when revisiting decisions.



## 4. What I still keep outside GitHub

Depending on the organisation, I might keep some things in other tools:

- Higher-level roadmaps and budgeting  
- Formal approvals or contracts  
- Long-form documentation that belongs in Confluence, SharePoint, etc.

The key is to **avoid duplication** and keep each artefact in the place where it will actually be maintained.



## 5. Linking this playbook to real projects

In my own GitHub portfolio, I:

- Use this playbook as a baseline.  
- Apply it in concrete example projects (e.g. Team To-Do Web App).  
- Keep links between:
  - Docs → Issues → Project boards.

This makes it easy for others to see how I would operate as an IT / Digital Project Manager in a GitHub-centric environment.
