# Working With Developers – Notes from an IT Project Manager

These are my personal guidelines for collaborating with developers in IT projects.



## 1. What developers usually need from a PM

1. **Clarity** – What are we building? For whom? What does “done” look like?  
2. **Prioritisation** – Of all possible work, what matters most right now?  
3. **Protection from chaos** – Help reduce interruptions and scope changes mid-sprint.  
4. **Context** – Why this feature exists and how it will be used.

I see my role as **translating** between business and technical worlds so that developers can focus on solving the right problems.



## 2. How I like to work day-to-day

- Keep a **single source of truth** for work items (e.g. GitHub Issues / Jira).  
- Use **clear user stories** with acceptance criteria instead of vague tasks.  
- Agree on a **Definition of Ready** and **Definition of Done** with the team.  
- Limit work in progress – better to finish a few things properly than start many things.



## 3. Communication patterns

- Prefer **async updates** for status (board, comments, short written notes).  
- Use stand-ups or check-ins to unblock, not to retell everything done.  
- When asking for estimates, provide enough context and avoid pushing for “the answer I want to hear”.



## 4. Anti-patterns I try to avoid

- Dropping “urgent” work into the middle of a sprint without discussion.  
- Changing acceptance criteria at the last minute.  
- Using tools in a way that creates more admin than value.  
- Treating developers as “task executors” instead of problem-solvers.



## 5. Handling disagreements

When there is tension (timelines, scope, technical approach), I try to:

1. Make the constraints explicit (time, quality, scope, budget).  
2. Ask the technical team to propose **options** with trade-offs.  
3. Bring stakeholders into decisions instead of promising on behalf of the team.



## 6. Continuous improvement

- Use retrospectives to learn what is and isn’t working.  
- Adjust processes, not just tell people to “work harder”.  
- Treat this playbook as a living document and update it as I gain real experience in different teams.
