# IT Project Management Playbook

This repository is my personal **IT / Digital Project Management Playbook**.

I created it to:

- Capture how I like to structure and run IT projects  
- Collect reusable templates (user stories, risk logs, release notes, etc.)  
- Show how I think about collaboration with developers and technical teams  

It is based on my experience in project management and my self-initiated IT projects (for example, the **Team To-Do Web App** case study in my other repository).



## 1. Who this playbook is for

- For **me** – as a living toolkit I can reuse and improve.  
- For **teams I work with** – as a starting point to align on ways of working.  
- For **hiring managers** – as a transparent view into how I approach IT project delivery.

This is not a “perfect standard”. It is a practical set of materials that I would adapt for each organisation.



## 2. What’s inside

### 2.1 Templates

Located in [`templates/`](./templates):

- **`user-story-template.md`**  
  Structure and checklist for writing clear user stories with acceptance criteria.

- **`risk-log-template.md`**  
  Simple but structured way to track risks, assumptions and mitigations.

- **`release-notes-template.md`**  
  Lightweight format for communicating what changed in a release.

- **`sprint-review-notes-template.md`**  
  Frame for running focused Sprint Reviews and capturing outcomes.

### 2.2 Guides

Located in [`guides/`](./guides):

- **`working-with-developers.md`**  
  How I like to collaborate with engineers: communication, expectations, and anti-patterns.

- **`using-github-as-an-it-project-manager.md`**  
  How I use GitHub Issues and Projects as a non-developer to manage work.

## 3. Principles behind this playbook

A few ideas that guide everything in this repository:

1. **Clarity over complexity**  
   Everyone should be able to understand *what we are doing, why, and what “done” means*.

2. **Lightweight but real**  
   Templates should be detailed enough to be useful, but not so heavy that nobody wants to fill them in.

3. **Technical empathy**  
   As an IT Project Manager I do not write most of the code, but I am responsible for creating an environment where developers can do their best work.

4. **Continuous improvement**  
   This playbook is version 1. I expect to adjust it as I join real teams, learn their constraints, and see what works in practice.



## 4. How I would use this in a real organisation

If I joined a new team, I would:

1. Start by understanding their **current processes and tools**.  
2. Use this playbook as a **conversation starter**, not a “you must follow this” rulebook.  
3. Adapt the templates to match:
   - terminology they already use,  
   - their tooling (Jira, Azure DevOps, GitHub, etc.),  
   - their level of maturity with Agile / Scrum / Kanban.  
4. Gradually introduce improvements rather than changing everything at once.

  (user stories, sprint plan, risk log, UAT, GitHub Project board).
